# Image-Compression-using-Quad-Tree-Format
۰ Compression of data has been around ever since long distance communication started  becoming prevalent. It was initially to minimize costs of sending a large letter or a very long  telegram message. ۰ When electronic communications became prevalent, bandwidth was a constraint and hence  compression of data and information became paramount for long dis25tance instantaneous  flow of information which is the backbone of our current global society. ۰ Traditionally, lossy compression schemes have focused on compressing data at fixed bit  rates to either communicate information over limited bandwidth communication channels, or  to store information in a fixed-size storage media. ۰ We wish to implement a class of lossless algorithms that is capable of compressing image  data over a wide range of rates so that quick browsing of large amounts of information as  well as detailed examination of high resolution areas can be achieved by the same  compression system. ۰ To accomplish this we use a quad tree structure to decompose an image into variable size  blocks which are subsequently quantized using a Tree-Structured Vector Quantizer (TSVQ).  The developed algorithms utilize variable-size image blocks encoded within quad tree data  structures to efficiently encode image areas with different information content
